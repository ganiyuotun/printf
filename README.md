# printfAbout this team project

The _printf function is a custom implementation of the printf function in C. It produces output according to a format string and supports the following conversion specifiers: %c, %s, and %%. It returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings) and writes the output to the standard output stream (stdout)
